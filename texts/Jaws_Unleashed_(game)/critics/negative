                                It's not one of those games you'll play forever, but I suspect that for many it will be one of those games that sits on the shelf so that any time you're feeling particularly evil or you've just had a bad day, you'll load it up and go eat some people.
                             
                                The game is fun whether you are playing in small doses or a long sit-down marathon as there is plenty to do, see, and kill along the way. The best part of it all is that it retails for under 30 bucks! That is like a dollar an hour considering that's about how long it will take to find and do everything.

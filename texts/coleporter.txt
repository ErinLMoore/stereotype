Times have changed
And we've often rewound the clock
Since the Puritans got a shock
When they landed on Plymouth Rock.
If today
Any shock they should try to stem
'Stead of landing on Plymouth Rock,
Plymouth Rock would land on them.
In olden days, a glimpse of stocking
Was looked on as something shocking.
But now, God knows,
Anything goes.
Good authors too who once knew better words
Now only use four-letter words
Writing prose.
Anything goes.
If driving fast cars you like,
If low bars you like,
If old hymns you like,
If bare limbs you like,
If Mae West you like,
Or me undressed you like,
Why, nobody will oppose.
When ev'ry night the set that's smart is in-
Truding in nudist parties in
Studios.
Anything goes.
When Missus Ned McLean (God bless her)
Can get Russian reds to "yes" her,
Then I suppose
Anything goes.
When Rockefeller still can hoard en-
Ough money to let Max Gordon
Produce his shows,
Anything goes.
The world has gone mad today
And good's bad today,
And black's white today,
And day's night today,
And that gent today
You gave a cent today
Once had several chateaux.
When folks who still can ride in jitneys
Find out Vanderbilts and Whitneys
Lack baby clo'es,
Anything goes.
If Sam Goldwyn can with great conviction
Instruct Anna Sten in diction,
Then Anna shows
Anything goes.
When you hear that Lady Mendl standing up
Now turns a handspring landing up-
On her toes,
Anything goes.
Just think of those shocks you've got
And those knocks you've got
And those blues you've got
From that news you've got
And those pains you've got
(If any brains you've got)
From those little radios.
So Missus R., with all her trimmin's,
Can broadcast a bed from Simmons
'Cause Franklin knows
Anything goes.
If you're ever in a jam, here I am.
If you're ever in a mess, S.O.S.
If you're so happy, you land in jail. I'm your bail.
It's friendship, friendship, just a perfect blendship.
When other friendships are soon forgot, ours will still be hot.
Da da da da da da dig dig dig.
If you're ever down a well, ring my bell.
If you're ever up a tree, just phone to me.
If you ever loose your teeth when you're out to dine, borrow mine.
It's friendship, friendship, just a perfect blendship.
When other friendships are soon forgot, ours will still be great.
Loddle doddle chuck chuck chaa.
If they ever black you're eyes, put me wise.
If they ever cook your goose, turn me loose.
And if they ever put a bullet through your brain, Ill complain.
It's friendship, friendship, just a perfect blendship.
When other friendships are soon forgit, ours will still be it.
Ah loddle doddle hip hap hap.
If you ever loose your mind, I'll be kind.
And if you ever loose your shirt, I'll be hurt.
If you're ever in a mill and get sawed in half, I won't laugh.
It's friendship, friendship, just a perfect blendship.
When other friendships are are up the crick, ours will still be slick.
Ah loddle doddle woof woof woof, hep hep hep, chopp chop chop, dig dig dig.
Good evening friends.
The night is young, the skies are clear
So if you want to go walking, dear,
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely.
I understand the reason why
You're sentimental, 'cause so am I,
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely.
You can tell at a glance
What a swell night this is for romance,
You can hear dear Mother Nature
Murmuring low,
"Let yourself go!"
So please be sweet, my chickadee,
And when I kiss you, just say to me,
"It's delightful, it's delicious,
It's delectable, it's delirious,
It's dilemma, it's delimit, it's deluxe,
It's de-lovely".
I feel a sudden urge to sing
The kind of ditty that invokes the spring.
I'll control my desire to curse
While you crucify the verse.
This verse I started seems to me
The Tin-Pantithesis of a melody
So spare us all the pain,
Just skip the darn thing and sing the refrain
Mi, mi, mi, mi,
Re, re, re, re,
Do, sol, mi, do, la, si.

You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize all others above
So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every home fire burning for
And we would be so grand at the game
Carefree together that it does seem a shame
That you can't see your future with me
Cause you'd be, oh, so easy to love
You'd be so easy to love
Easy to idolize all others above

My story is much too sad to be told,
But practically everything leaves me totally cold.
The exception I know is the case
When I'm out on a quiet spree,
Fighting vainly the old ennui,
And I suddenly turn and see your fabulous face.
I get no kick from champagne.
Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all.
So tell me why should it be true
That I get a kick out of you?
Some, they may go for cocaine.
I'm sure that if I took even one sniff
It would bore me terrifically, too.
Yet I get a kick out of you.
I get a kick every time I see
You standing there before me.
I get a kick though it's clear to see
You obviously do not adore me.
When love comes in
And takes you for a spin,
Ooh-la-la-la, c'est magnifique!
when every night
Your love one holds you tight,
Ooh-la-la-la, c'est magnifique!
But when, one day,
Your ,love one drifts away,
Ooh-la-la-la, it's so tragique!
But when, once more,
He whispers "Je t'adore!",
C'est magnifique!

In the still of the night
As I gaze out of my window
At the moon in it's flight
My thoughts all stray, stray to you
In the still of the night
While the world lies in slumber
Oh the times without number
When I say to you
Do you love me
Just like I love you
Are you my life to be
That dream come true
Or will this dream of mine
Will it fade way out of sight
Just like that moon growing dim
Way out on the rim of the hill
In the still of the night
Once I loved such a shattering physician,
Quite the best-looking doctor in the state,
He looked after my physical condition
And his bedside manner was great!
When I'd gaze up and see him there above me,
Looking less like a doctor than a Turk,
I was tempted to whisper, "Do you love me,
Or do you merely love your work?" [flat]
He said my bronchial tubes were entrancing,
My epiglottis filled him with glee,
He simply loved my larynx
And went wild about my pharynx,
But he never said he loved me.
He said my epidermis was darling [discover veins- ah]
And found my blood as blue as can be,
He went through wild ecstatics
When I showed him my lymphatics,
But he never said he loved me.
And though, no doubt, it was not very smart of me,
I get on a-wracking of my soul,
to figure out why he loved every part of me,
And yet not me as a whole.
With my esophagus he was ravished, [tiger claws]
Enthusiastic - to a degree,
He said 'twas just enormous, my appendix vermiformis,
But he never said he loved me.
He said my cerebellum was brilliant,
And my cerebrum far from N G,
I know he thought a lotta
My medulla oblongota,
But he never said he loved me.
He said my maxillaries were marvels,
And found my sternum stunning to see,
He did a double hurdle
When I shook my pelvic girdle,
But he never said he loved me.
He seemed amused,
When he first made a test of me
To further his medical art.
Yet he refused,
When he's fixed up the rest of me,
To cure that ache in my heart.
I know he thought my pancreas perfect,
And for my spleen was keen as can be,
He said, of all his sweeties,
I'm the sweetest diabetes,
But he never said he loved me. No he never said he loooeeeved...
He lingered on with me till morning
And when I went to pay him his fee
He said, "Don't be funny, it is I who owe you money" Ah!
But he never said, no he never said, no he never said he loved me
Every time we say goodbye, I die a little
Every time we say goodbye, I wonder why a little
Why the gods above me, who must be in the know
think so little of me that they allow you go
When your near there's such an air of Spring about it
I can hear a lark somewhere begin to sing about it
There's no love song finer but how strange
The change from major to minor
Every time we say goodbye
Every time I look down on this timeless town
Whether blue or gray be her skies.
Whether loud be her cheers or soft be her tears,
More and more do I realize:
I love Paris in the springtime.
I love Paris in the fall.
I love Paris in the winter when it drizzles,
I love Paris in the summer when it sizzles.
I love Paris every moment,
Every moment of the year.
I love Paris, why, oh why do I love Paris?
Because my love is near.
Oh, give me land, lots of land under starry skies above
Don't fence me in
Let me ride through the wide open country that I love
Don't fence me in
Let me be by myself in the evenin' breeze
And listen to the murmur of the cottonwood trees
Send me off forever but I ask you please
Don't fence me in
Just turn me loose, let me straddle my old saddle
Underneath the western skies
On my Cayuse, let me wander over yonder
Till I see the mountains rise
I want to ride to the ridge where the west commences
And gaze at the moon till I lose my senses
And I can't look at hovels and I can't stand fences
Don't fence me in
Oh, give me land, lots of land under starry skies
Don't fence me in
Let me ride through the wide country that I love
Don't fence me in
Let me be by myself in the evenin' breeze
And listen to the murmur of the cottonwood trees
Send me off forever but I ask you please
Don't fence me in
Just turn me loose, let me straddle my old saddle
Underneath the western skies
On my Cayuse, let me wander over yonder
Till I see the mountains rise
Ba boo ba ba boo
I want to ride to the ridge where the west commences
And gaze at the moon till I lose my senses
And I can't look at hobbles and I can't stand fences
Don't fence me in
No
Poppa, don't you fence me in
Why shouldn't I take a chance when romance passes by?
Why shouldn't I know of love?
Why wait around when each age has a sage who has sung
That upon this earth love is all that is really worth thinking of?
It must be fun, lots of fun
To be sure when day is done
That the hour is coming when you'll be kissed
And then you'll be kissed again
All debutantes say it's good
And every star out in far Hollywood
Seems to give it a try
So why shouldn't I?
All debutantes say it's good
And every star out in far Hollywood
Seems to give it a try
So why　 shouldn't　 I?
You do something to me
Something that simply mystifies me
Tell me, why should it be
You have the power to hypnotize me?
Let me live 'neath your spell
Do, do that voodoo that you do so well
For you do something to me
That nobody else could do
Let me live 'neath your spell
Do, do that voodoo that you do so well
For you do something to me
That nobody else could do
That nobody else could do
The day is my enemy, the night my friend,
For I'm always so alone till the day draws to an end,
But when the sun goes down and the moon comes through,
To the monotone of the evening's drone I'm all alone with you.
All through the night,
I delight in your love,
All through the night you're so close to me!
All through the night,
From a height far above,
You and your love brings me ecstasy!
When dawn comes to waken me,
You're never there at all!
I know you've forsaken me
Till the shadows fall,
But then once again I can dream, I've the right
To be close to you all through the night.
It's too darn hot
It's too darn hot
I'd like to sup with my baby tonight
Refill the cup with my baby tonight
I'd like to sup with my baby tonight
Refill the cup with my baby tonight
But I ain't up to my baby tonight
'Cause it's too darn hot
It's too darn hot
It's too darn hot
I'd like to coo with my baby tonight
And pitch the woo with my baby tonight
I'd like to coo with my baby tonight
And pitch the woo with my baby tonight
But brother, you fight my baby tonight
'Cause it's too darn hot
According to the Kinsey Report, ev'ry average man you know
Much prefers his lovey-dovey to court
When the temperature is low
But when the thermometer goes 'way up
And the weather is sizzling hot
Mister, pants for romance is not
'Cause it's too, too, too darn hot
It's too darn hot
It's too, too darn hot
I'd like to coo with my baby tonight
And pitch the woo with my baby tonight
I'd like to coo with my baby tonight
And pitch the woo with my baby tonight
But brother, you fight my baby tonight
'Cause it's too darn hot
According to the Kinsey Report, ev'ry average man you know
Much prefers his lovey-dovey to court
When the temperature is low
But when the thermometer goes 'way up
And the weather is sizzling hot
Mr. Gob for his squab
A marine for his queen
A G.I. for his cutie-pie is not
'Cause it's too, too, too darn hot
It's too darn hot
It's too darn hot
It's too darn hot
It's too darn hot
It's too darn hot
From this moment on
You for me, dear
Only two for tea, dear
From this moment on
From this happy day
No more blue songs
Only hoop-de-doo songs
From this moment on
You've got the love I need so much
Got the skin I love to touch
Got the arms to hold me tight
Got the sweet lips to kiss me goodnight
From this moment on
You and I, babe
We'll be ridin' high, babe
Every care is gone
From this moment on
You've got the love I need so much
Got the skin I love to touch
Got the arms to hold me tight
Got the sweet lips to kiss me goodnight
From this moment on
You and I, babe
We'll be ridin' high, babe
Every care is gone
From this moment
From this moment
This very moment
This moment on
I love you
Hums the April breeze.
I love you
Echo the hills.
I love you
The golden dawn agrees
As once more she sees
Daffodils.
It's spring again
And birds on the wing again
Start to sing again
The old melody.
I love you,
That's the song of songs
And it all belongs
To you and me.
It's spring again
And birds on the wing again
Start to sing again
The old melody.
I love you,
That's the song of songs
And it all belongs
To you and me.
I was a hum-drum person
Leading a life apart
When love flew in through my window wide
And quickened my hum-drum heart
Love flew in through my window
I was so happy then
But after love had stayed a little while
Love flew out again
What is this thing called love?
This funny thing called love?
Just who can solve its mystery?
Why should it make a fool of me?
I saw you there one wonderful day
You took my heart and threw my heart away
That's why I ask the Lawd up in Heaven above
What is this thing called love?
You gave me days of sunshine
You gave me nights of cheer
You made my life an enchanted dream
'Til somebody else came near
Somebody else came near you
I felt the winter's chill
And now I sit and wonder night and day
Why I love you still?
Chinks do it. Japs do it
Upper Lapland little Lapps do it
Let's do it
Let's fall in love
In Spain the best upper sets do it
Lithuanians and Lits do it
Let's do it
Let's tall in love
The Dutch in old Amsterdam do it
Not to mention the Finns
Folks in Siam do it
Think of Siamese twins
Some Argentines without means do it
People say in Boston even beans do it
Let's do it
Let's fall in love
Cold Cape Cod clams
'Gainst their wish do it
Even lazy jelly fish do it
Let's do it
Let's fall in love
Electric eels I might add do it
Though it shocks'em I know
Why ask if Shad do it
Waiter bring me Shad Roe
In the shallow shoals English soles do it
Goldfish in privacy of bowls do it
Let's do it
We'll do it
Let's do it
Let's fall in love
I've got you under my skin
I've got you deep in the heart of me
So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me
I've got you under my skin
I'd tried so not to give in
I said to myself this affair never will go so well
But why should I try to resist when baby I know so well
I've got you under my skin
I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of having you near
In spite of a warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear
Don't you know little fool
You never can win
Use your mentality, wake up to reality
But each time that I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
'Cause I've got you under my skin
I would sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of having you near
In spite of the warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats how it yells in my ear
Don't you know, little fool
You never can win
Why not use your mentality
Step up, wake up to reality
But each time I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop just before I begin
'Cause I've got you under my skin
Yes, I've got you under my skin
Rosalie, my darling,
Rosalie, my dream.
Since one night when stars danced above,
I'm oh, oh, so much in love,
So Rosalie, have mercy.
Rosalie, don't decline.
Won't you make my life thrilling
And tell me you're willing to be mine,
Rosalie, mine.
Have you heard? The coast of Maine just got caught in a hurricane?
Well did you ever? What a swell party this is!
Have you heard that poor dear Blanche got run down by an avalanche?
Well, did you ever? What a swell party this is!
What daiquiris! What sherry, please! What burgundy! What pommery!
Have you heard? Professor Munch ate his wife and divorced his lunch?
Well, did you ever ? What a swell party this is!
Misses Smith in her new Hup crossed the bridge when the bridge was up,
Well, did you ever ? What a swell part this is!
What brandy, wow! What whiskey, here's how!
What gin and what beer, will you sober up, dear?

When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender,
It brings back a night of tropical splendor,
It brings back a memory ever green.
I'm with you once more under the stars,
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine.
To live it again is past all endeavor,
Except when that tune clutches my heart,
And there we are, swearing to love forever,
And promising never, never to part.
What moments divine, what rapture serene,
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted,
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted,
I know but too well what they mean;
So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember;
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine.
Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you,
Till you whisper to me once more,
"Darling, I love you!"
And we suddenly know, what heaven we're in,
When they begin the beguine
Whenever skies look gray to me
And trouble begins to brew,
Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,
I concentrate on you.
When fortune cries "Nay! Nay!" to me
And people declare "You're through!",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.
On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine
And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you.
Do I love you, do I?
Doesn't one and one make two?
Do I love you do I?
Does July need a sky of blue?
Would I miss you, would I
If you ever should go away?
If the sun should desert the day
What would life be?
Will I leave you, never?
Could the ocean leave the shore?
Will I worship you forever?
Isn't heaven forevermore?
Do I love you, do I?
Oh, my dear it's so easy to see
Don't you know I do, don't I show you I do?
Just as you love me
Will I leave you, never?
Could the ocean leave the shore?
Will I worship you forever?
Isn't heaven forevermore?
Do I love you, do I?
Oh, my dear, it's so easy to see
Don't you know I do, don't I show you I do?
Just as you love me
After watching your appeal from ev'ry angle
there's a big romantic deal I've got to wangle
For I've fallen for a certain luscious lass
And it's not a passing fancy or a fancy pass
I love the look of you, the lure of you
The sweet of you, the pure of you
The eyes, the arms, the mouth of you
The east, west, north, and the south of you
I'd love to gain complete control of you
And handle even the heart and soul of you
So love, at least, a small percent of me, do
For I love all of you

It's the wrong time and the wrong place
Though your face is charming, it's the wrong face
It's not her face, but such a charming face
That it's all right with me
It's the wrong song in the wrong style
Though your smile is lovely, it's the wrong smile
It's not her smile, but such a lovely smile
So it's all right with me
You can't know how happy I am that we've met
I'm strangely attracted to you
There's someone I'm trying so hard to forget
Don't you want to forget someone, too?
It's the wrong game with the wrong chips
Though your lips are tempting, they're the wrong lips
They're not her lips, but they're such tempting lips
That if some night you're free
Dear, it's all right
Yes, it's all right with me

It was just one of those things
Just one of those crazy flings
One of those bells that now and then rings
Just one of those things
It was just one of those nights
Just one of those fabulous flights
A trip to the moon on gossamer wings
Just one of those things
If we'd thought a bit before the end of it
When we started painting the town
We'd have been aware that our love affair
Was too hot not to cool down
So good-bye, dear, and amen
Here's hoping we meet now and then
It was great fun
But it was just one of those things
Is it an earthquake or simply a shock?
Is it the good turtle soup or merely the mock?
Is it a cocktail, this feeling of joy?
Or is what i feel the real McCoy?
Is it for all time or simply a lark?
Is it Granada i see or only Asbury park?
Is it a fancy not worth thinking of?
Or is it at long last love?
Is it an earthquake, or simply a shock?
Is it the good turtle soup, or is it merely the mock?
Is it a cocktail, this feeling of joy?
Or is what i feel the real McCoy?
Is it for all time or simply a lark?
Is it Granada i see or only Asbury park?
Is it a fancy, not worth thinking of?
Or is it at long long	long last love?
A thorough knowledge I've got about girls
I've been around
And after learning a lot about girls
This is the important fact I found
I've no proof when people say
I'm more or less aloof
But you're sensational
I don't care if you are called,
"The Fair Miss Frigidaire"
'Cause you're sensational
Making love is quite an art
What you require
Is the proper squire
To fire your heart
And if you say
That one fine day
Birds do it, bees do it
Even educated fleas do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love
In Spain, the best upper sets do it
Lithuanians and Letts do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love
The Dutch in old Amsterdam do it
Not to mention the Finns
Folks in Siam do it; think of Siamese twins
Some Argentines without means do it
People say in Boston even beans do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love
Romantic sponges, they say, do it
Oysters down in oyster bay do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love
Cold cape cod clams 'gainst their wish do it
Even lazy jellyfish do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love
Electric eels, I might add, do it
Though it shocks 'em I know
Why ask if shad do it? Waiter, bring me shad roe
In shallow shoals English soles do it
Goldfish in the privacy of bowls do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love


Like the beat beat beat of the tom-tom
When the jungle shadows fall
Like the tick tick tock of the stately clock
As it stands against the wall
Like the drip drip drip of the raindrops
When the summer shower is through
So a voice within me keeps repeating you, you, you
Night and day, you are the one
Only you beneath the moon or under the sun
Whether near to me, or far
It's no matter darling where you are
I think of you, night and day
Day and night, why is it so
That this longing for you follows wherever I go
In the roaring traffic's boom
In the silence of my lonely room
I think of you, night and day,
Night and day, night and day
Under the hide of me
There's an oh such a hungry yearning burning inside of me
And it's torment won't be through
Until you let me spend my life making love to you

I hate men!
I can't abide them, even now and then!
Than ever marry one of them I'd rest a maiden rather,
For husbands are a boring lot and only give you bother!
Of course I'm awfully glad that mother deigned to marry father!
But I hate men!
Of all the types I've ever met within our democracy,
I hate the most the athlete with his manner bold and brassy!
He may have hair upon his chest, but sister, so has Lassie!
Oh I hate men!
I hate men!
They should be kept like piggys in a pen!
Don't wear a travelling salesman, though a tempting tom he may be,
For on your wedding night he may be off to far Araby!
While he's away in Mandalay, 'tis thee who'll have the baby!
Oh I hate men!
I hate men!
Though roosters they, I will not play the hen!
If you espouse an older man through girlish optimism,
He'll always stay at home at night and make no criticism;
Though you may call it love, the doctors call it rheumatism!
Oh I hate men!


Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today, madam
Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today
She is sorry to be delayed, but last evening down in Lovers Lane, she strayed, madam
Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today
When she woke up and found that her dream of love was gone, madam
She ran to the man who had led her so far astray
And from under her velvet gown, she drew a gun and shot her lover down, madam
Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today
When the mob came and got her and dragged her from the jail, madam
They strung her up on that willow across the way
And the moment before she died, she lifted up her lovely head and cried, madam
Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today
Yes, the moment before she died, she lifted up her lovely head and cried, madam
Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today




While tearing off a game of golf
I may make a play for the caddy
But when I do, I don't follow through
Cause my heart belongs to Daddy
If I invite a boy some night
To dine on my fine food and haddie
I just adore, his asking for more
But my heart belongs to Daddy
Yes, my heart belongs to Daddy
So I simply couldn't be bad
Yes, my heart belongs to Daddy
So I want to warn you laddie
Though I know that you're perfectly swell
That my heart belongs to Daddy
Cause my Daddy, he treats it so well
While tearing off a game of golf
I may make a play for the caddy
But when I do, I don't follow through
Cause my heart belongs to Daddy
If I invite a boy some night
To cook up some hot enchilada
Though Spanish rice is all very nice
My heart belongs to Daddy
Yes, my heart belongs to Daddy
So I simply couldn't be bad
Yes, my heart belongs to Daddy
So I want to warn you laddie
Though I know that you're perfectly swell
That my heart belongs to Daddy
Cause my Daddy, he treats it so well
Love for sale,
Appetizing young love for sale,
Love that's still fresh and unspoiled,
Love that's only slightly soiled.
Love for sale,
Who will buy?
Who would like to sample my supply?
Who's prepared to pay the price,
For a trip to Paradise?
Love for sale,
Let the poets pipe of love,
In their childish way,
I know every type of love,
Better far than they.
If you want the thrill of love,
I've been through the mill of love,
Old love, new love,
Every love but true love.
The farce was ended,
The curtains drawn,
And I at least pretended
That love was dead and gone.
But now, from nowhere,
You come to me as before
To take my heart,
And break my heart once more.
Get out of town
Before it's too late, my love.
Get out of town,
Be good to mister please!
Why wish me harm?
Why not retire to a farm
And be contented to charm
The birds off the trees?
Just disappear,
I care for you much too much,
And when you are near,
Close to me dear,
We touch too much!
The thrill when we meet
Is so bitter-sweet
That, darling, it's getting me down;
So on your mark,
Get set,
Get out of town!





I'll remember forever
When I was but three
Mama, who was clever
Remarking to me
If son when you're grown up
You want everything nice
I've got your future sewn up
If you take this advice
Be a clown, be a clown
All the world loves a clown
Act the fool, play the calf
And you'll always have the last laugh
Wear the cap and the bells
And you'll rate with all the great swells
If you become a doctor, folks'll face you with dread
If you become a dentist, they'll be glad when you're dead
You'll get a bigger hand if you can stand on your head
Be a clown, be a clown, be a clown
Be a clown, be a clown
All the world loves a clown
Show 'em tricks, tell 'em jokes
And you'll only stop with top folks
Be a crack Jackanapes
And they'll imitate you like apes
Why be a great composer with your rent in arrears
Why be a major poet and you'll owe it for years
When crowds'll pay to giggle if you wiggle your ears
Be a clown, be a clown, be a clown
Be a clown, be a clown
All the world loves a clown
If you just make 'em roar
Watch your Mounte bank account soar
Wear a painted mustache
And you're sure to make a big splash
A college education I should never propose
A bachelor's degree won't even keep you in clothes
But millions you will win if you can spin on your nose
Be a clown, be a clown, be a clown
Give 'em quips, give 'em fun
And they'll happy to say you're A-1
If you become a farmer you've the weather to buck
If you become a gambler you'll be stuck with your luck
But Jack you'll never lack if you can quack like a duck
Be a clown, be a clown, be a clown



Why can't you behave?
Oh, why can't you behave?
After all the things you told me,
And the promises that you gave,
Oh, why can't you behave?
Why, why, why can't you be good?
I was faithful and true but what good will it do
And do, do just as you should?
Yes you had the right touch but I was askin' too much
Won't you turn that new leaf over,
So your baby can be your slave?
Oh, why can't you behave?
There's a farm I know near my old home town,
Where we two can go and try settling down.
There I'll care for you forever,
'Cause you're all in this world I crave.
Oh, why can't you behave?
Why can't you behave?

I've got my eyes on you,
So best beware where you roam.
I've got my eyes on you,
So don't stray too far from home.
Incidentally,
I've set my spies on you,
I'm checking all you do
From A to Z,
So, darling, just be wise,
Keep your eyes on me.
Incidentally,

If you're wise,
Keep your eyes on me.

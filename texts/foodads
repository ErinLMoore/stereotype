5 Gum
I've been chewing a lot of gum, and so far there is only one I found to have long-lasting flavor, that lasts all day or all night. To prove how long the flavor lasts, I'm standing in traffic risking it all, and I won't leave until the flavor ends or I can't chew anymore.

The name of the gum is called 5, it comes in a black package. And you can get it in different flavors like spearmint, cooling peppermint, and Cinnamon. Spearmint is called rain ,and it's in a green package, peppermint is called cobalt in the blue package, and cinnamon is called flare in the orange package. Actually, the package is black but the number 5's are in the different colors. The statement they make about it is that it will "stimulate
your senses" that is true because the flavor is non stop.

Woman bystander: Oh my goodness! He let himself get hit by that car!

Man bystander: Yep, but his gum still sure is looooong lasting!

Woman bystander: eeewww!

Arnold's Breads
Let me tell you about the Arnold bread man ... lots of years ago, when I was just a little kid, he’d make deliveries to our house every day, just like the milkman and the iceman. I remember to this day, those special tiny loaves he carried and the big smile on his face when he gave me one. Now, I know the Arnold bread man doesn’t deliver anymore, but every day I can still see a variety of ARNOLD’S BREADS on the grocer’s shelves -- so I know he’s still around.

Baileys Caramel and Mint Chocolate
Baileys Caramel and Mint Chocolate
Until now, the major flaw in favoritism was that you could only have one favorite in any category. But the introduction of two delicious new flavors from Baileys - tempting Caramel and classic Mint Chocolate - proves having one favorite quite insufficient. Thus you may, as of now, be partial to romance movies, sci-fi flicks, and documentaries, and keep a dog, a cat and a fish, as your favorite pet. You may have three favorite songs, three favorite uncles, and three best friends, who naturally enjoy your three favorite drinks: Original and new Caramel and Mint Chocolate Baileys. Two more smooth, creamy favorites, from your favorite. Baileys reminds you to please drink responsibly.

Millions of people,

here's to doing the right thing,
to giving a damn
here's to the straight talkers,
who give their word and keep it
here's to freedom, wherever you find it.
And to knowing the true meaning of wealth
Here's to the brave amongst us
Here's to a code of behaviour
that sets certain men apart from all others
Here's to us
Live with Chivalry.

Dos Equis Beer: The most Interesting man in the World - Part 1

If he were to punch you in the face you would have to fight off a strong urge to thank him

He is.. the most interesting man in the world!

Healthy Cooking by Sharon Claessens
Healthy Cooking by Sharon Claessens
Preface
Good Eating and Good Health
It was barely a generation ago that indigestion, heartburn and ulcers were considered the very signs of “success.” Even alcohol abuse was considered part of the “successful lifestyle” in business or the arts—providing, of course, that one drank only luxury brands. Food was essentially irrelevant to any notion of success, so long as the gin was cold, the beef was hot, and there was plenty of both.
What a distance we’ve traveled since then!
What is our notion of success today?
A recent Gallup Poll revealed the astonishing fact that people now equate success not with a wonderful job, not with a beautiful home, not, in fact, with any traditional measure of accomplishment. Rather, the poll—commissioned by Success Magazine—found the current notion of success is GOOD HEALTH.
And why not?
With health, and all that the word no implies—vitality, strength, emotional vigor—all of life becomes available for enjoyment. Not just parts, like one’s job, but every moment.
If personal destiny is to be seen in terms of health, we can say that each of us, to a large degree, carves our destiny with knife and fork. Food, after all, is our future—quite literally. Health in its every dimension can be nourished or negated by the mouthful.

Heineken Handlebar Mustache
Heineken Handlebar Mustache :30

The handlebar mustache. It's not right for every occasion. Unless, that is, you find yourself drafted into an old-timey bare knuckle boxing match…

there are some things best saved for the right occasion. But then, they make those occasions even righter.

Just like, under every handlebar mustache there's a little Heineken light.

Heineken. Open your world.

Jack Daniel's
In Lynchburg, Tennessee, you can park in the middle of the road to talk with a neighbor about taxes or the weather. You can pick enough wild blackberries to fill a tin bucket.

One sip, and you’ll be glad to know we don’t ever plan to stop. Jack Daniel’s ... smooth sippin’ Tennessee whiskey.

 
 
  
 
  
Jack Daniel's - Giving the Right Gift
Giving the right gift is easy. Just follow these simple steps.

Second, get some wrapping paper and ribbon. It’s kinda like wrappin’ a tennis racket. They’re gonna know what it is, but that’s part of the charm.

And last, and most important, step three. Be there when they open it.

LINGUINI AND BOB RESTAURANT
When dining formally, in order to avoid an embarrassing utensil faux pas, observe the following protocol: Begin by locating the seafood fork which lies horizontally across your plate. Grasping this fork between thumb and forefinger, proceed to shove it into the ear of the person directly to your left. Next, to impress business associates, stick your soup spoon up your nose and exclaim, “Look at me, I’m a bowl of soup.” When the entree arrives, use the butter spreader to catapult particularly juicy portions onto the balding heads of nearby diners. And finally, quietly finish with the dessert utensils found at the top of your plate. All the while, of course, making odd gurgling noises and clucking like a chicken. This lesson in table etiquette has been brought to you by Linguini and Bob, who invite you to enjoy serious Italian food in a not-so-serious atmosphere. Linguini and Bob, now open at Butler Square in Minneapolis.

Working out here in the hot sun all day can really get to you after a while. That’s why the refreshing feeling that I get from a Mountain Dew is worth more to me than almost anything at all. Take it from me ... Mountain Dew is the cool refresher you’ll ask for time and time again. MOUNTAIN DEW ... the soft drink that stands by itself.

 
 
  
 
  
Mountain Dew - Diet 2
In these shark infested waters, a team of scientists and one brave volunteer are about to find the answer to an important question. Is Diet Mountain Dew as much of a thrill as regular Dew. The results were clear, Diet Mountain Dew is all the Dew with none of the calories. “How Dew does Diet.”

 
 
  
 
  
Mountain Dew- Diet

Mueller's
Down on the Gulf Coast, a shrimp dinner is an old familiar way of eatin’. What’s surprisin’ is how good, along with the shrimp, Mueller’s spaghetti can be. Mueller’s is more than a great meal by itself…it tastes right good, along with other great meals. That’s probably why more people buy Mueller’s spaghetti than any other brand in this country. Nothing goes with everything….like Mueller’s.

We are casting a quirky character to be the new Mr. Peanut - think silly, jolly and wise. This will be a 3D animated commercial that will play in IMax theaters across the country. It's a fresh take on the classic Mr Peanut. The character will make several human-type sound effects - at the end of your audition read include one of each of the following: grunt, ahem, sneeze, jolly giggles (a small jiggle, a medium jiggle and a big old grand jolly giggle), and a silly yippee. Please insert no more than one second pause between each sound effect. No slate.

Orange Juice
Everyone agrees that preventing illness is a lot easier than curing it. And one of the easiest ways to reduce some health risks is to drink 100% Pure Florida Orange Juice. It’s loaded with Vitamin C -- an anti-oxidant that may reduce the risk of some types of cancer. So remember, when it comes to health care, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure -- and 8 ounces of ORANGE JUICE is very valuable indeed.

Pillsbury Dough-boy Dies
The Pillsbury Doughboy died Monday, of a severe yeast infection, and complications from repeated pokes to the belly. He was 81. Doughboy was buried in a lightly greased coffin.

Celebrities by the baker's dozen turned out, including Mrs. Butterworth's, Hungry Jack, Betty Crocker, Martha White, Sara Lee, Duncan Hines, Count Chocula ... and Capt. Crunch. The California Raisin's choir sang, "The Loaf's Prayer". The Gravesite was pilled high with enriched flowers. As long-time friend Aunt Jemiamah delivered the eulogy, describing Doughboy as a man who often spoke of his younger days, unting chocolate mousse back home, in the hills of Bavarian Cream. She went on to say, he was a hummber fritter, and never knew how much he was "kneaded".

This best friend and confidant, Rocky Road spoke of their early days of playing around with Italian Meringues and LadyFingers, but later in his day-old days, he was happy with his wife and family in their gingerbread home next to the muffin man, on Drury Lane. Doughboy rose quickly in show business pie-pan circles, but his later life was stuffed with many turnovers.

He was not considered the smartest cookie in the batch, wasting much of his dough on half-baked schemes, and decorated tarts with sprinkles. Described in many recipes as a little flaky texture at times, but after his mid-life turnovers, even as a crusty old tart, many of the young gingersnaps Jello-molded their lives after him.

His autobiography, "Souffle" has risen to #1 on the best-seller list. His 2nd wife, Butter-Cream, formally Miss PlayDough of the month, survives Doughboy, along with their Twinkies, Eclaire & Pate". Mrs. Dough said, of their 40-year recipe for marriage, "It was a piece of Cake".

The funeral was held at 350 degrees for about 45 minutes, until he was golden brown. May he rest in yeast.

Prego Restaurant
Paulo has just enjoyed his fabulous meal of Capellini al Pomodoro at Prego, the restaurant. He pays the bill and makes his way toward the bar. Everyone admires him. Or so it seems to Paulo. He is on the prowl. He is a cat, a panther. He is ... Paulo. He waves to the Prego staff and calls them by name. Giancarlo! Giuseppe! Roberto! They do not answer. These are not their names. But Paulo is pleased. He believes he has made am impression on the leggy brunette perched at the end of the bar. She is kittenish, thinks Paulo. But I am the bigger cat. A lion, thinks Paulo. She looks up. What is that she sees? It is the blueness of his eyes? The strength of his chin? No, it is the spinach caught between his teeth. It has been there for hours. Prego. Union Street. San Francisco. See. Be Seen. Be seen eating.

 
 
  
 
  
Prego Restaurant 2
Francesca is waiting for her friend at Prego, the restaurant. She sits by the window and gazes at the women on the street. They are no rivals for me, thinks Francesca. Their skirts are not as short. Their lips do not pout like mine. Their hair is not as ... big. Francesca tosses her head in defiance. Her big hair does not move. It is hard. Like fiberglass. She orders the Pizza Margherita from the fabulous Prego menu and she watches them pass by. She looks at their shopping bags. They are not the nice ones with the little cord handles and shiny paper like Francesca’s, that says she has spent more money than she had to, and that she does not care that she spent so much money. Besides, it makes such a nice purse. Finally her friend arrives, her best friend in the world! Does Francesca kiss her on both cheeks? No, she kisses the air on both sides of her friend’s head. Francesca cares not. It is not as if she likes her best friend.

 
 
  
 
  
Prego Restaurant 3
Carlo and Maria have come to Prego, the restaurant, for their fabulous food. But they are too in love to notice the food. They have been in love for a very long time now. For over an hour, which is a record for the both of them. Maria plucks a mezzelune from her plate and feeds it to Carlo. He is a little plaything, she thinks, like a puppy -- loyal, eager, panting ... drooling. She takes a bite of his Agnello Grigliato. The people at Prego stare, but Carlo and Maria, they care not. They are blinded with love. It is a game of cat and mouse. Of kiss and tell. Of ... crime and punishment. Carlo glances at her. Ah! She is perfect. But what’s that? A crumb is stuck to her chin! Maria has noticed something herself. A sucking sound. Could that be Carlo eating? Oh, Carlo! Oh, Maria! Their disillusionment is as thick as the minestrone.

Here at Runza, many people ask us why we don’t serve breakfast. Our answer is simple, because we’re busy making lunch. We’re up with the roosters each morning to start hand slicing onion rings and making Runza sandwiches. And we wouldn’t have time for that if we had to spend our mornings figuring out how to inject syrup into bread. Seriously, people actually do that, but not us, because we don’t do everything. We do our thing. Runza, the difference is real.

Uncle Ben's 2
Don’t laugh, but I started using Uncle Ben’s after I was in this taste test. They had a whole lot of us comparing Uncle Ben’s and the other leading national brand...my rice. What a difference! Uncle Ben’s looked better, tasted better, wasn’t sticky, Turns out Uncle Ben’s beat my old rice something like two to one.

Wednesday
Today is Wednesday. Hump day. Mid-week. Named after the Norse god Woden, also known as Odin the Wanderer. And what does that mean? It means that if you don't get off that couch and wander, explore, discover, then you are besmirching the very namesake of the day in question. Odin the Wanderer was not afraid to see what the night had in store, and he ended up having a day of the week named after him. If that's not something to raise a crisp, clean Budweiser to, we don't know what it...Budweiser. Venture. It's what we do.

What a Real Woman Does
A real woman is a man's best friend. She will never stand him up and never let him down. She will reassure him when he feels insecure and comfort him after a bad day.
She will inspire him to do things he never thought he could do; to live without fear and forget regret. She will enable him to express his deepest emotions and give in to his most intimate desires.
She will make sure he always feels as though he's the most handsome man in the room and will enable him to be the most confident, sexy, seductive, and invincible. . .
No wait... Sorry... I'm thinking of beer.
That's what beer does...
Never mind.

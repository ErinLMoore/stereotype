The microphone.  Hello?  (SINGING) Let me point out from the start that I don't wish to paint you.  (SINGING) I'm a scholar and physician.  Sartore! Sartore!  [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]  [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]  [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]  [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]  [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]  [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]  [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]  [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [LAUGHTER]  [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Come on [BLEEP]! [BLEEP]!  --a month at the most and at the least. Estimate it. Do the math. You don't even sit down and do that.  I don't have to. I bring home the money.  Well, yeah, to that [UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE] because I've been asking you to do that.  You just know what you know, and you block out everything you hear. You just tell me the same thing. Yeah. That's how I feel.  It's like--  Well, you could wake me up.  Tell me to get up.  Well, if you asked me to. I mean, that's like--  I guess I'm--  No, I mean that's one of my few weaknesses. I do have some weaknesses.  [? But I don't disagree-- ?]  Yeah. He isn't as tactful as you are. But see then, I can be late but he can't.  You know, you may be right.  I'm conscious of it, but as you say that-- --the reality of those times when she'd forget about me for hours-- boy. Well, those were very turbulent times for me.  Yeah. God, I hated her for that. The message was very clear. The message was very clear. Boy, life's complex. What about those shoes, anyhow?  No, they're pretty shoes, too. They're nice. I have a friend, Alessandro. He lives in Abadiania, and I show you when he walk around. He had multiple sclerosis. That's the right name? OK, he could not walk, problem to move, even to talk. Only his mother could understand him. He came here today, every day you can see he go into university, walking, he play volleyball with the people around. [SPEAKING VIETNAMESE] [SPEAKING VIETNAMESE] [SPEAKING VIETNAMESE] [SPEAKING VIETNAMESE]  Problem is, we haven't had a good track record.  I want the Kung Pao chicken.  Yeah, number eight.  We need that car shut off in lane two.  I just need to get a thumbs up, ready in lane one from Paul Carmichael. Thumbs up in lane two, Vernon. Watch the leader board, here we go.  51.6 in lane two.  50.8.  And Vernon Sergeant is our winner in street a. Way to go Vernon. Paul Charmichael, great run.  She's not afraid of nobody. She's not afraid of anyone, anyone at all. She has a wonderful personality. You can change [UNINTELLIGIBLE] [BLEEP] off. Here, get a shot of my big belly. Here you go. That'll be gone about the time I get home. Come on, blow the whistle. Aw, [BLEEP], situps. Aw, [BLEEP]. Clockwise. Clockwise. Think of a clock, clockwise. Mark time, march. Lock and load. You fired three rounds. Three rounds. How many holes do you see? [BLEEP] This is going to be a lot different than just hunting back home. Welcome to Fort Hood. This stuff is pretty simple from here on out. Take that two right there. [INAUDIBLE], stay where you're at. [INAUDIBLE], stay where you're at. Hold your weapons to your right. Incoming! So these five ton dump trucks, the youngest one we have is 1956. The newest one we have is 1964. We were promised up-armor kits. We didn't get them. And so we're going to go ahead and try to fabricate something. Thank you sir. You think we could use some of this stuff? Yeah, let's take that with us. I hear that.  I advise you to come to Pakistan and serve you country, to serve the country where you were born. Because America is already an advanced country, and they don't need any intellectual [UNINTELLIGIBLE]. But Pakistan requires many persons who are intellectual and highly educated. What? What? Who? I'm not going back. I don't want to even see it no more. Uh-uh. I ain't going back to that. Yeah, when I was at my house in New Orleans, yeah, I used to play it on my TV. So I got a little bit of skills behind this thing. FEMA, FEMA. We was working across the river today. As you can see, we cleared up all of St. Charles. We cleared out all Louisiana. We clearing up everywhere. We're just cleaning up, man. And it's giving me something to do, keep me from thinking about my family most, sitting down, just concentrating on doing something constructive. They was trying to run us out of the houses and stuff, talking about evacuating. But why shall I leave? They got people coming in from out of town working. I talked to a guy before I got the job where I'm working at now. This guy was from Houston, Texas, a temporary worker working on it. Why the citizens that live here can't stay down here and work? It doesn't make sense. They got so much money coming up. Yeah, let the locals rebuild it. And he want to run us out. Oh, I don't know. They're talking about like two to three months, something like that. It's going to be really hard, because I shed a few tears because I miss them, but I know they in a better place than where I'm at. But I don't know where they at. I don't know where anyone at. I can't even talk to my mother. She left before the storm. The day before the storm she was in Mississippi. I haven't talked to her since. You have a safe trip. Watch yourself, because the army people just told me they got some bad guys running around. Yeah, he say they in the area. Must be. Don't come creeping up that fast again, OK? That's fine. When somebody does that, you stop. We don't know who you are. I appreciate that. Seen anything that we need to know about around here? All right, we appreciate it. Just be safe, all right?  It's a mess, ain't it? It's a mess. Along with the water that went through it. Ask Boss FEMA! You go down around here are the Zuni Indians are. They're the ones that are handing out the ice. You can ask them where the Iceman is. And so you'll see him. He's got kind of a hat on. Looks like a safari hat. And he looks like Crocodile Dundee to me.  I John, 2: My dear children, I write this to you so that you will not sin.  But if anybody does sin, we have One who speaks to the Father in our defense.  His name is Jesus Christ, the Righteous One.  He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins. And not only for ours-- --but also for the sins of the whole world.  At this time, has everyone gotten a plate? Because we have plenty of food and plenty of service. I do have an indistinct feeling about Kerry. I'd like to know more about his views on the national security issues. This is the primate laboratory at the University of Wisconsin in Madison. In this laboratory, there are approximately 120 rhesus monkeys, the subject of a study that wants to know the answer to the question, what is an infant's love for its mother?  What's her address?  Yeah, how much?  That'll be $36.  Allied Interstate calling in regards to an important personal matter that was described in a letter to you. Due to federal and ethical state statutes, no further information may be left. This is not a solicitation.  And you are the man of the hour? OK. I'm the administrative assistant to the warden and public information officer. And you are? Anthony-- Pico. OK. What's your claim to fame, Mr. Pico? You're a success story? Well, you are. I can look in your eyes and tell. You are definitely a success story.  Who you looking for? Yeah. No. Wrong room. Guardian scholars? I'm not sure where you go.  Happy Holidays from the Parkland College Business Club. I certainly know voice you're talking about. The voice is irresistible, always. I'm in the thrall of that voice. Up until recently, that voice has made me a very poor man. I remember somehow realizing just how finely calibrated the voice was to every nuance, every part of my feelings, including the feeling that I didn't want to smoke cigarettes. And it's just like, might as well have another cigarette, because this is it. Tomorrow you're going to quit. And then tomorrow something would happen, and there's a good reason to smoke that day. And then it was, oh you already smoked today, so today's not the day you are going to quit, so smoke another cigarette. The voice definitely brings in also an element of shame. It says, you want everyone to think that you have money. You want everyone to see that you're generous and you can give and put yourself out there financially. It will prove that you're not a poor kid. I think I probably gave the bank over $2,000 in service charges. That voice. It was so charming.  Most of the stuff, honestly, most of the things I learned about sex are probably from watching pornography, because there's a lot there. You might as well be taking notes, because it's very up close and personal. And they're not trying to censor themselves. So they can show anything they want. And you learn. Because they're wearing condoms most of the time.  Look right over here. Half covered in dirt and sand, you've got 1984, and then three feet away is 1969. And there's 1966. And if we walk up this road, the numbers are going to keep dropping off and off and off, and go decades back. And you think about right here, in the span of just three feet, are the remains of thousands of people. And from 10 feet away, you would never know that these plaques are here. Here you go, last one. I don't like the way they translated it, but OK. Read this. In dreams, they had dreams. God did not speak to them. There are many prophets. God bless you.

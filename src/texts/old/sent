Where’s that?


Yeah bro.


It was great. First time I had 24 hours off in a while. Got to see my friends and stuff. How was your weekend?


This is why we’re single, Michael.


It was alright. I had a meeting, then I got some drinks with friends.


I have class early in the morning. What are you up to tomorrow night?


Topiary.


What’s the best place to get a burrito?


My week, weekend, month, year, all look horrible. I’m in rehearsal for 4 different shows, and my day job is nuts right now. Can I let you know?


Well, I fell asleep.


I’ll be honest, I’m surrounded by disaffected record store snobs, so dudes who are into sports turn me on now, in a weird way.


Hahahahaha cool. Let me know if you wind up going out. 


You might murder me.


Pizza. You?


Pretty busy. You?


Was hanging out with my roommates and watching a movie. You?


Just saw a movie with my friend and I’m going to go to bed early I think. How about you?


I think it’s weird that Australians call “Sprite” “lemonade”. I think it's weird that in Chicago strangers talk to you on public transit. 


Or we could just take a bike ride.


Sounds relaxing.


Hahahaha thanks. How's your Christmas going?


Did Flaming Lips do that awesome thing with the rodent balls?


Cool! My number is 2037389069. Let me know what works for you.


Do you get to camp often.


Definitely don’t want to rush into that experience.


I am in my office wearing three sweaters and I am very sleepy.


Is the baby REALLY your niece though?


Do you have a favorite one of his films?


I’m a big fan of Murakami as well, what’s your favorite book of his?


Favorite coffee shop is definitely Bowtruss.


Nope! Bye!


I am so sorry, I have class tonight, but I’ll shoot you a text when I get back from Colorado for sure!


I’ve never been there.

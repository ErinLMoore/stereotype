so mr. trump, let me add to that, when you walked off that bus at age 59, were you a different man or did that behavior continue until just recently? and you have two minutes for this.please hold the applause. secretary clinton, you have two minutes.secretary clinton,i will let you respond.and secretary clinton, i do want to follow-up on e-mails. you’ve said your handling of your e-mails was a mistake, you’ve disagreed with the fbi director james comey calling your handling of classified information “extremely careless”. the fbi said there were 110 classified e-mails which were exchanged, eight of which were top secret and it was possible hostile actors did gain access to those e-mails. you don't call that extremely careless?we go to gorbah hameed for a question for both candidates.mr. trump, you’re first.secretary clinton.thank you, secretary clinton. mr. trump, in december you saidwhy did it morph into that. no answer the question. would you please explain whether or not the muslim ban still stands?secretary clinton, let me ask you about that. you have asked for an increase from 10 to 65,000 syrian refugees. we know you want tougher vetting. that's not a perfect system. so why take the risk of having those refugees come into the country?i would like to move on.she did not. very quickly please.thank you mr. trump. i want to move on. this next question comes from the public through the bipartisan open debate coalition’s online forum where americans submitted questions that generated millions of votes. this question involves wikileaks’ release of purported excerpts of secretary clinton’s paid speeches speeches, which she has refused to release. in one line in particular, in which you secretary clinton purportedly say, ‘you need both a public and private position on certain issues.’ so, two from virginiawe will get to that later. secretary clinton, you are out of time.thank you mr. trump.we’re going to move on to syria. both of you have mentioned that.mr. trump, we will go on. mr. trump, we are going to move on. the heart breaking video of a 5-year-old syrian boy named omran sitting in an ambulance after being pulled from the rubble after an airstrike in aleppo focused the world's attention on the horrors of the war in syria, with 136 million views on facebook alone. but there are much worse images coming out of aleppo every day now where in the past few weeks alone 400 have been killed, at least 100 of them children. just days ago, the state department called for a war crimes investigation of the syrian regime of bashar al-assad and of its ally, russia, for their bombardment of aleppo. so this next question comes from social media, through facebook. diane from pennsylvania asks if you were president, what would you do about syria and the humanitarian crisis in aleppo? isn’t is a lot like wasn't it like the holocaust when the u.s. waited too long before we helped? secretary clinton, we will begin with your two minutes.thank you secretary clinton. mr. trump.mr. trump, your two minutes is up.mr. trump, let me repeat the question. if you were president, what would you do about syria and the humanitarian crisis in aleppo, and i want to remind you what your running mate said. he said provocations by russia need to be met with american strength and that if russia continues to be involved in airstrikes along with the syrian government forces of assad, the united states of america should be prepared to use military force to strike the military targets of the assad regime.you disagree with your running mate?what are do you think will happen if aleppo falls?what will happen if it falls?there are sometimes reasons the military does that. psychological warfare.it might be to get civilians out.tell me what your strategy is it.i’m going to go to secretary clinton, you want assad to go, you advocated arming rebels, but it looks like that may be too late for aleppo. you talk about diplomatic efforts, those that failed, ceasefires have failed. would you introduce the threat of u.s. military force beyond a no-fly zone against the assad regime to back up diplomacy?what would you do different than than president obama is doing?you had many answers.secretary clinton -- we are moving on.secretary clinton we are moving to an audience question, we are almost out of time and we have another question. mr. trump, we are moving on.mr. trump, we want to get to the audience. thank you very much, both of you. we have another audience question. beth miller has a question for both candidates.we begin with your two minutes, secretary clinton.secretary clinton. thank you. you are out of time. mr. trump?we will get on to one more question.we have one more question.we sneak in one more question from karl becker.mr. trump, would you like to go first?mr. trump?thanks to both of you.tune in on october 19th for the final debate at the university of nevada las vegas. good night, everyone. chris

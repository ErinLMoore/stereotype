and i'm anderson cooper from cnn, we want to welcome you to washington university in st. louis for the second presidential debate between hillary clinton and donald trump sponsored by the commission on presidential debates. tonight's debate is a town hall format which gives voters the chance to directly ask the candidates questions. martha and i will ask follow-up questions but the night really belongs to the people in this room and to people across the country who committed questions online. the people you see on this stage were chosen by the gallup organization, are all from the st. louis area and told gallup they have not committed to a candidate. each of them came here with questions they wanted to ask and we saw the questions for the first time this morning. anderson and i and our team from abc and cnn are the only ones who have seen them. both candidates will have two minutes to answer each audience and online question we hope to get to as many questions as we can. we asked the audience not to slow things down with any applause, except for now. ladies and gentlemen, the republican nominee for president, donald j. trump and the democratic nominee for president, hillary clinton. story continued belowthank you very much for being here. we will begin with a question from one of the members in our town hall. each of you will have two minutes to respond to this question. secretary clinton, you won the coin toss so you’ll go first. our first question comes from patrice brock. patrice?mr. trump you have two minutes.thank you mr. trump. the question from patrice was about ‘are you both modeling positive and appropriate behaviors for today's youth?’ we received a lot of questions online, mr. trump about the tape that was released on friday, as you can imagine. you called what you said ‘locker room banter’. you described kissing women without consent, grabbing their genitals. that is sexual assault. you bragged that you have sexually assaulted women. do you understand that?for the record, are you saying that what you said on the bus 11 years ago, that you did not actually kiss women without consent or grope women without consent?so for the record, you’re saying you never did that?--have you ever done those things?thank you very much. secretary clinton, do you want to respond?we want to remind the audience to please not talk out loud. please do not applaud. you are just wasting time.we have to move on. secretary clinton you get to respond, then we have to move on.secretary clinton, you get to respond then we have to move on to a audience question.please allow her to respond. she didn't talk while you talked.let her respond.we brought up the e-mails.ken karpowitz has a question.that first one goes to secretary clinton. you started out the last one to the audience.secretary clinton.secretary clinton, you are out of time. mr. trump, you have two minutes.secretary clinton, let me follow-up with you, your husband called obamacare “the craziest thing in the world”, saying small business owners are getting killed, premiums doubled, coverage is cut in half. was he mistaken or was his mistake simply telling the truth?--your time is up--mr. trump, let me just follow-up----mr. trump, you’ve said you want to end obamacare, you’ve also said you want to make coverage accessible for people with preexisting conditions. how do you force insurance companies to do that if you are not mandating that everyone has insurance?what does that mean?are you going to have a mandate that americans have to have health insurance?thank you mr. trump.actually on the topic of taxes, we have a question from spencer moss.mr. trump, you have two minutes.secretary clinton you have two minutes. the question was, what specific tax provisions would you change to ensure the wealthiest americans pay their fair share of taxes.mr. trump, i want to give the chance to respond. i just want to tell our viewers what she’s referring to. in the last month, taxes were the number one issue on facebook for the first time in the campaign. the new york times published three pages of your 1995 tax returns that show you claimed a $960 million loss, which means you could have avoided paying personal federal income taxes for years. you’ve said you pay state taxes, employee taxes, real estate taxes, property taxes. you have not answered, though, a simple question. did you use that $960 million loss to avoid paying personal federal income taxes?can you say how many years you have avoided paying personal federal income taxes?i want you to respond,please allow her to respond. she didn't interrupt you.we have a question from james carter.that question begins for mr. trump.your two minutes is up.you have two minutes.secretary clinton, your two minutes is up. i want to follow on with something donald trump said to you. a comment you made last month. you said half of donald trump supporters are quote deplorables. racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, islamophobic. you later said you regretted saying half. you didn't express regret for using the term deplorables. to mr. carter’s question, how can you unite a country if you've written off tens of millions of americans?mr. trump, let me follow-up with you. in 2008, you wrote in one of your books that the most important characteristic of a good leader is discipline. you said if a leader doesn't have it, quote he or she won't be one for long. in the days after the first debate, you sent out a series of tweets fromyou mentioned ‘‘sex tape.’secretary clinton, does mr. trump have the discipline to be a good leader?we have to move along.we have one more question from ken bone about energy policy.mr. trump, two minutes.your time is up. secretary clinton, two minutes.i want to thank the university here and this concludes the town hall meeting. thank you to washington university and everybody who watched.
